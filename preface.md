# Preface {-}

I love reading books, especially beautiful books. Everytime I read a nicely formatted book, I told myself I would want to make a book that looks exactly like this. But I'm yet to find an app that allows me to do that. Alright, now I'm writting it myself and call it Bookless!

This is the first book written using Bookless, about how to use it to write a book just like this one.

Bookless is built on top of [Pandoc][pandoc-website]. Hence many parts of this book will come from [Pandoc manual][pandoc-manual]. You should check them out if you want to build a writing app. Still, this book is about how to write a book, so let's get started!
