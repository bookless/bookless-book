# Preface

I love reading books, especially beautiful books. Everytime I read a nicely formatted book, I told myself I would want to make a book that looks exactly like this one. But I'm yet to find an app that allows me to do that. So now I'm writting it myself and call it Bookless. And this is the first book written using Bookless, about how to use it to write a book just like this one.
