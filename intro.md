# Introduction

## Motivation

Writing a book is hard. It's harder if we don't have a powerful enough tool for it. Although it has some similarity with coding, writing is definitely not coding. I am a coder, I code mostly on an IDE. They are called IDE for a reason. It integrates many development tools into on powerful editor. I'm not needing that when writing. When writing something, I want to turn on the full focus most. Focus only to what I am thinking and writing at the moment. Nothing else. That the first thing I want when creating Bookless: the focus mode.

There is rarely anyone who are writing a one-chapter book. I love to organize things for the sake of self sanity. So my book should be divided into chapters. That the second things Bookless must have: the chapters explorer. And as they say these days, plain text files are kings. Of course they are! Not every computers come with a pre-installed expensive Microsoft Word. But I assure you, every single one can edit a plain text file. So these chapters are, not very surprisingly, just plain text files on your computer.

Every book should be beautifully formatted. That's not even for debate. But not every one can do that. So Bookless should come with some nice-looking pre-defined templates so authors could really get started quickly.

## Get started

Just download Bookless from its [website][bookless-web], and then install it to your computer.

- Open it
- Choose a folder to working on
- Create or editing an existing file

Now you are just writing a brilliant beautiful book yourself!

## Usage

A typical book contain many chapters. They will be displayed on your left bar. Click the bookmark icon to expand it if it's hidden. Click again to enter focus mode. You can double click on the top area to toggle the mode if you like.

The content are automatically saved so you don't have to. You should put your book on a backup system like Dropbox or iCloud to prevent any unwanted accident that may happen to your computer.
