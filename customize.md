# Customization


## Preferences

Bookless allows you to customize these book preferences:

- Title
- Author
- Date
- Language
- Font family
- Font size
- Line height

All configuration will be saved on _bookless.yaml_ file. This is a valid Pandoc defaults file so you can use Pandoc command line to generate the book without Bookless.
